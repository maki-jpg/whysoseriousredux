<h1 class="intitle">The Making of Harvey Dent</h1>
	

<p>Two years ago, few beyond the cloistered world of City Hall knew the name "<a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Harvey Dent</a>."  Today <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> stands at the forefront of Gotham politics, with an enormous electoral victory and a golden image as the city's "White Knight."
</p><p>
<a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Harvey Dent</a> was born to a middle-class family in Granton during an era where Gotham City was racked by urban riots and civil unrest. His mother, a schoolteacher for the local grammar school, raised him by herself after Dent's father died in a work accident at the Gotham World Chemical Company.
</p><p>
The young <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Harvey Dent</a> impressed teachers with his diligence and coaches with his athletic abilities. But some who knew him as a child report that <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> carried within him a unique determination.
</p><p>
"You couldn't tell him that he wasn't old enough to do something," said his third-grade teacher Sally Rowe Bowling. "<a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Harvey</a> refused to give up. That's why I volunteered for his campaign the moment I heard he was running."
</p><p>
Other teachers remember a boy who seemed somehow different from others. "He was a serious-minded boy," said Gabriella Cohn-Solomon, his fifth-grade teacher. "There was something sad about him. Like he was already grown up."
</p><p>
After graduating from one of Gotham's first magnet high schools, <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Harvey Dent</a> decided to stay in the city for college. "He could have gone anywhere," said his high school guidance counselor Jeremy Benthune. "But <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Harvey</a> said Gotham City was his family, and that he could never leave it."
</p><p>
<a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> attended the University of Gotham, where he played soccer for the varsity team and majored in Political Science. After graduating with honors, he returned to the school for a law degree.
</p><p>
<a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> began his professional career as a litigator with the prestigious downtown firm of Carlson and Piques. "He always wanted a career in government, but he felt he needed some real-world seasoning before becoming a civil servant," according to partner Lars Bensuhn.
</p><p>
<a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> did well at Carlson and Piques, earning a promotion and the respect of the partners. "When <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Harvey</a> told me he was accepting a job at the District Attorney, I did everything I could to keep him," Bensuhn said. "But <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Harvey</a> felt he could make a difference for the people of Gotham, and he politely refused my offers."
</p><p>
<a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> quickly took action as Assistant District Attorney. Working with <a href="../investigations/gpdiad.htm">GPD's Internal Affairs division</a>, <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> began an investigation into police corruption that netted eleven guilty verdicts. He built his reputation as an anti-corruption crusader when he initiated the creation of the <a href="../investigations/wata.htm">"We Are The Answer" citizen tip line</a>, which allowed Gotham residents to phone in suspicions of corrupt police officers.
</p><p>
The public aspect of the GPD corruption investigation earned <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> considerable media attention, both positive and negative. <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent's</a> public image took a beating when police officer <a href="../suspects/breitup.htm">Karl Breitup</a> was shot and killed during an <a href="../investigations/bettyswiretapmain.htm">arrest attempt at the House of Pies</a>. The incident, along with <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent's</a> targeting of the GPD, earned <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> the enmity of many rank and file officers.
</p><p>
This antagonism may have contributed to the attacks of <a href="../investigations/ccfabg.htm">Concerned Citizens for a Better Gotham</a>, which used Gotham police officers to falsely accuse <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> of bogus prosecutions. The attacks almost derailed <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent's</a> campaign.
</p><p>
But <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> beat back the charges, and <a href="../investigations/ibihdpress.htm">his courageous behavior defusing a hostage situation at Rossi's Deli</a> earned him a new sobriquet &mdash; "The White Knight of Gotham." The wave of publicity surrounding the incident put him in a commanding position in the last  part of the campaign. Today, he is set to become Gotham's 38th District Attorney after winning by a margin unheard of in Gotham politics.
