<h1 class="intitle">Arrest or Embrace? <br />Politicians Unsure How To Deal With Batman</h1>
	

<p>Since <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> emerged out of the darkness in the grim, crime-ridden Gotham night, he has become a lightning rod for controversy. Is he another symptom of the lawless anarchy into which some say Gotham City has descended? Or is he a cause for hope, a sign that average citizens may be taking a first step to fighting back against a crime wave that continues to worsen?
</p><p>
The Gotham Police Department reports that "the individual some are calling <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">The Batman"</a>, as he is known on official documents, has made 23 appearances at crime scenes in Gotham. <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> has stopped a bank robbery in progress, rescued hostages during the "Post Office bombing", made several "snatch and grab" missions against reported organized crime leaders, and prevented several street muggings and shake-down attempts.
</p><p>
Through it all, though, Gotham politicians seem uncertain how to react to <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a>. While most fear a wave of vigilantism, others argue that <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> is effectively fighting crime and providing hope to a wounded city. These conflicting attitudes are hobbling City Hall's attempts to agree on a single policy with regards to <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a>.
</p><p>
With City Hall so split on <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a>, the public's more positive attitude towards <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> seems to be holding sway. Just this week, an attempt to issue an arrest warrant for <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> seems to have been put on hold after running into steep public opposition and internal disapproval.
</p><p>
Circles close to the acting District Attorney <a href="../suspects/garcetti.htm">Roger Garcetti</a> had been drawing up papers and devising a strategy to see Batman prosecuted on an array of charges. These charges included illegal use of force, kidnapping, impersonating a law enforcement official, criminal endangerment, being a public nuisance, and damage to public property.
</p><p>
One aide close to DA <a href="../suspects/garcetti.htm">Garcetti</a> said, "It is clear that <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> is operating above the law, which is simply intolerable." The aide said charging <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> was "simply a matter of when, not if."
</p><p>
However, when word seeped out that <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> was in legal jeopardy, an outpouring of support flooded into City Hall.
</p><p>
Phone operator Millicent Snarp said she's never received so many angry callers demanding to talk to the mayor. "It was non-stop citizen calls for about three days, and it's continuing. I didn't receive one call in support of jailing <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a>," she said.
</p><p>
But regardless of what the public thinks was going on, DA <a href="../suspects/garcetti.htm">Garcetti</a> denied that he had pushed for Batman's arrest. <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">"Batman</a> is nothing more than a dangerous vigilante, but right now we have bigger fish to fry." <a href="../suspects/garcetti.htm">Garcetti</a> refused to rule out arresting Batman in the future. "How could I rule  out enforcing the law?" <a href="../suspects/garcetti.htm">Garcetti</a> said.
</p><p>
"If <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> obeys the law, he will not be prosecuted by this office. But if <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> continues to flaunt the law, then he will be arrested. Justice in this city is blind," continued <a href="../suspects/garcetti.htm">Garcetti</a>.
</p><p>
Inside sources told <em>The Times</em> that <a href="../suspects/garcetti.htm">Garcetti</a> and Mayor <a href="../suspects/garcia.htm">Anthony Garcia</a> are no friend to the masked man who has won the hearts of many in crime-ravaged Gotham. Opposing them are many of their aides and political consultants, who warn of grave public damage to their image if they go after the popular <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a>.
</p><p>
Jamie Stearne, a political consultant in Gotham who is not advising either man, said it might be "political suicide" to take on <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> right now.
</p><p>
"Look, going after <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> in this town, at this moment, when crime is soaring and people think <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> is the only one fighting the criminals, is just not very smart," Stearne said. "The public is beginning to see <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> as their protector, almost a father figure, and they will not look too kindly on attempts politicians make to arrest him."
</p><p>
The latest <em>Times</em> poll, taken November 16-18, shows that 69% of Gothamites believe that <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> is a force for good in the city.
</p><p>
"You don't get to be politically successful by going against 69% of your voters. If I were <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a>, I'd feel pretty safe about not going to jail, at least not right now," Stearne said.
