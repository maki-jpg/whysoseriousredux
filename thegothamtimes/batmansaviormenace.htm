<h1 class="intitle">Batman: Savior or Menace?</h1>
	
<p>On the day of <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Harvey Dent</a>'s landslide victory, <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> upstaged the new district attorney with  a dramatic election-day intervention and the narrow defeat of the "Save Batman" Proposition D on the ballot.
</p><p>
Amid widespread reports of voter intimidation at Gotham polling sites,  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> saved a <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> supporter at East City Park from three club-wielding men. The incident helped dramatize the Gotham proposition that voters nixed, which would have required GPD to make arresting vigilantes its "lowest priority."
</p><p>
The "Save Batman" proposition was widely debated in the city, and led to a vigorous campaign by supporters and opponents. The proposition battle crystallized the main question facing Gotham &mdash; whether  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> is helping  to curb crime in Gotham or leading to an "every man for himself" anarchy.
</p><p>
"Gotham itself seems torn," said longtime political watcher Walt DeFabrizio. "People cheer  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> for striking back at criminals, but they fear him as a sign of an unpredictable future."
</p><p>
Indeed, the voting numbers reflect the closely-divided sentiments of the city &mdash; Proposition D was voted down, carrying 49% of the vote.
</p><p>
<a href="../investigations/cfb.htm">Citizens for Batman</a> founder <a href="../suspects/douglass.htm">Brian Douglass</a> was a major proponent of the proposition but had little to celebrate at the Yes on D party in Gotham Square. "Criminals are  running rampant, so  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> has to pick up the slack and protect our citizens," Douglass said.
</p><p>
<a href="../investigations/cfb.htm">CFB</a> members were a crucial element of the Yes on D campaign, as members handed out flyers, went door-to-door, and held rallies chanting "Save Batman, Save Gotham!"
</p><p>
But in a sign of the passions  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> inspired, many rallies were marred by physical fights between pro-Batman and anti-Batman proponents.
</p><p>
"<a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> is not fighting criminals, he is a criminal," said Stone Sargey, spokesman for No on D. "Every civilized nation treats vigilantism as a serious crime, and the day Gotham City does otherwise is a day we will be destined to mourn."
</p><p>
Ever since the emergence of  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> in the Gotham skies and streets, City Hall has maintained a policy that <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> would be arrested and charged with breaking the law. This policy enraged pro-Batman citizens and led to Proposition D. Its defeat today means that  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> will still be a target of the GPD under the current policy.
</p><p>
"It's not clear whether this proposition would have done anything at all to the question of arresting  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> even if it passed," said Gotham lawyer John DeHaviliarn. "The wording is vague and open to interpretation, and nothing stands in the way of any cop arresting  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> even after its passage."
</p><p>
Still, the proposition spawned a loud and passionate anti-Batman movement, made up of a collection of police officers, business interests, and citizens more scared of runaway vigilantism than Gotham's crime rate, said DeFabrizio.
</p><p>
 <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman's</a> intervention outside of a polling station came as the polls were about to close.  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> stopped three men as they were about to club a <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> supporter on the ground screaming for help. Witnesses report that in just under a minute,  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> swooped in, carried off all three men, and tied them to a nearby tree.
</p><p>
"Before I knew it,  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> was off again," said Elmira Cleansworthy III, who was a volunteer at the precinct. "I wanted to thank him, but he just disappeared!"
</p><p>
The three men appeared at the polling station at just after five p.m., witnesses said. Wielding baseball bats, the men intimidated voters and warned them not to vote for <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Harvey Dent</a>.
</p><p>
One eyewitness told <em>The Gotham Times</em> that the men threatened voters with "a broken leg for every <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> vote." The men placed themselves in front of the polling station and waved their baseball bats in a threatening manner, eyewitnesses said.
</p><p>
"It was horrible," said Cleansworthy. "Those men were intimidating every voter, and physically  manhandled the <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Dent</a> supporters who argued with them."
</p><p>
Gotham Police Department sources say one of the men in custody is <a href="../suspects/rossi.htm">Albert Rossi</a>, a Maroni mob associate who also owns <a href="../investigations/rossi.htm">Rossi's Deli</a> where <a href="../investigations/ibihdpress.htm">Dent defused a hostage situation on May 13</a>. GPD did not release the names of the other men being held.
</p><p>
One witness reported that  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> used "a line" to scale a building before making his escape.
</p><p>
GPD officer Jessica Victor-Stearns told <em>The Times</em> that the three men were found bound, gagged, and tied with a series of complicated knots that tighten if struggled against. "They were gift wrapped, ready for booking," Victor-Stearns said. "I don't agree with this kind of vigilantism, but I have to admit it made the locals feel a lot safer about coming out to vote."
</p><p>
"I assure the citizens of Gotham that the GPD is working closely with the election commission to investigate every single one of these allegations," said <a href="../suspects/loeb.htm">Police Commissioner Loeb</a>. "Mark my words, we will not tolerate any kind of intimidation tactics at polling stations."
</p><p>
But Police Commissioner Loeb rejected  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a>'s intervention. "The people of Gotham will not stand for vigilante justice," Loeb said. "This kind of irresponsible behavior is dangerous to everyone involved."
</p><p>
The voters seemed to agree with Loeb, refusing to send a message to City Hall to ease up on their anti-Batman policy. But the larger question of whether Batman is Gotham's savior or Gotham's menace is one that will continue to be debated, said DeFabrizio.
</p><p>
"As long as  <a href="../suspects/batman.htm">Batman</a> is around, he will inspire both admiration and fear," said DeFabrizio. "This time around, the fear won out. But in the future, it could be different."
