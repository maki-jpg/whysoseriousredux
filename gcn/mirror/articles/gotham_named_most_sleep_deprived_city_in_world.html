                   <h1>GOTHAM NAMED "MOST SLEEP DEPRIVED CITY IN WORLD"</h1> 
<p>
    <img alt="" src="../../gcnjoker/images/articles/clock.jpg" />Is it the constant noise of horns, sirens, and 24-hour bustle? Or is it fear of violent crime or Fear Toxin outbreaks? 
<br /><br />
Whatever the reason, Gotham beat out Cairo for the title of the Most Sleep-Deprived City in the World according to an annual study by urban experts.
<br /><br />
All the coffee, caffeine-laden soda drinks, and energy drinks in the world can't solve the problem of sleepy Gotham citizens, said Dr. Henry Rechter of the National Institute for Slumber Research. 
<br /><br />
"What we're facing is a sleep crisis," said Rechter. "And sleep-deprived people are more likely to get involved in car accidents, violence, and drug and alcohol abuse." 
<br /><br />
The average Gotham citizen gets just 6.3 hours of sleep per night, according to the study. Many residents report less than 5 hours of sleep a night. Experts say that most people need 8 to 8.5 hours of sleep a night.
<br /><br />
Dr. Stephanie Hart-Loveless, from Gotham General Hospital, was a local consultant in the study. "There's been a lot of sources for increased stress in the past year, and we're starting to see the effects," said Hart-Loveless.
<br /><br />
"It's a vicious cycle. People who haven't slept properly go to work, or come home, and they've got short tempers, or they can't remember things, and they just create more stress."
<br /><br />
But do the bleary-eyed Gotham masses think they are sleep deprived? The answer is no. 78% of those who slept less than 6 hours a night felt that they were sleeping as much as they needed to.  
<br /><br />
Again, Dr. Rechter: "People won't admit to being sleep-deprived. But they're hitting the snooze bar repeatedly, taking daytime naps, show dark circles under their eyes. They just don't make the connection."
<br /><br />
And who might the most famous victim of sleep deprivation be in Gotham? Dr. Rechter says the most weary of us might be Batman himself. 
<br /><br />
"When he should be sleeping, he's out fighting crime," Rechter said. "That's got to harm his sleep patterns."
