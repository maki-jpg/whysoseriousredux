                   <h1>HOME-PROTECTION BUSINESS SOARS AS FEAR HITS GOTHAM</h1> 
<p>
    <img alt="" src="../../gcnjoker/images/articles/home_protection.jpg" style="padding-left:15px;" />The Desmond family of Gotham Heights spent over $20,000 on a high-tech protection service for their million-dollar home. And they're not alone. 
<br /><br />
As crime continues to rise throughout Gotham City, the home-security business is booming. "Crime's terrible for the city, but great for business," according to Theo Smytheson, one of the owners of Acme Security Systems. 
<br /><br />
"If this keeps up, I'll be able to retire by 45. And I'll know I helped protect our families," said Smytheson
<br /><br />
So how can you help guard your home or apartment from Gotham's criminals? There are a variety of options, and not all of them are budget-busters. 
<br /><br />
Worried families can choose from fully customized systems that involve electronic "trip wires" and motion sensors to simpler, cheaper options. 
<br /><br />
Alarms that trigger when a lock is broken with notifications instantly sent to both the police and a private security company are especially popular. 
<br /><br />
"You don't have to be Bruce Wayne to protect your family," Katie Tyler of Acme told GCN. "Our entry-level system is based on a monthly fee of only $49.95â€¦ that's even cheaper than basic cable."
<br /><br />
Some consumer activists in the city aren't so high on many of the security options, however. They claim they offer Gotham citizens nothing more than a false sense of peace of mind. 
<br /><br />
"These so-called security systems do little more than alert the police, and the security companies charge thousands of dollars for that," according to Nina Rona Touchstone, a reporter for The Gotham Consumer Advocate, a free publication found in many local supermarkets. 
<br /><br />
"In most burglary situations, the homeowner or resident could simply dial 9-1-1 in the same time it takes a system to do the same thing," said Touchstone. "These overpriced gadgets simply do not keep your families or possessions safe." 
<br /><br />
The Gotham Police Department also has qualms about home security systems. Some in the department say proliferating home alarms could end up making us all less safe. 
<br /><br />
Spokesman Randall Dandridge explained that "more often than not, these things trigger too easily and result in over 100 false alarms a month. That's time wasted that could have been spent doing real police work."
<br /><br />
Despite such warnings, sales of home security systems have risen by a whopping 35% in the past three months in the city with no sign of a slowdown in sight. For many Gotham citizens, it's better safe than sorry.
