                   <h1>HARVEY DENT: CAN THE "WHITE KNIGHT OF GOTHAM" WIN?</h1> 
                   
                    <img alt="" src="../images/harvey_dent_small.jpg" />                   
<p>As Gotham readies to vote in one of the most bitterly-contested elections in city history, can Harvey Dent really win? He hasn't been trailing in the polls for over a month. But even his most fervent supporters aren't certain of his chances. 
<br /><br />
"We've always been the underdog," said volunteer coordinator Ace DiBella. "We've taken on City Hall, organized crime, and everybody in the press who said we couldn't do it. So do I believe the poll numbers saying we're winning? Not a chance." 
<br /><br />
Even political experts in Gotham are suspicious of recent tracking polls showing Dent leading his primary rival Roger Garcetti by over 15 points. 
<br /><br />
"Roger Garcetti is a trusted name in Gotham politics," said longtime Gotham pol Sidney Shinerman. "And Harvey Dent is relatively inexperienced. I think we're moving into a second-thoughts phase, where voters are going to start to wonder if Dent is really up to the job."
<br /><br />
What's causing the worry inside the Dent campaign? Many insiders fear legendary Gotham political shenanigans, such as ballot stuffing and improper voter rolls. "I don't believe that the syndicate that controls Gotham City will let us win," said Dent supporter Shane Broadbent of Gainsly. "But I'm going to do my best to prove myself wrong!" 
<br /><br />
The Dent campaign has also had to suffer through a political "near-death experience" - the hard-hitting, now debunked attack ads mounted by Concerned Citizens for a Better Gotham. 
<br /><br />
"We've already been crushed once by the political machine," said Gotham citizen Maureen Alton-Spitzen, who was passing out pro-Dent flyers outside of a grocery store in Granton. "Who's to say they won't pull a last-minute trick like that?" 
<br /><br />
Indeed, at the height of the smear campaign, Dent fundraising collapsed, his poll numbers hit the floor, and the campaign headquarters was closed due to lack of funds. 
<br /><br />
But all that changed on the day Harvey Dent strode into the middle of the hostage scene at Rossi's Deli and traded himself for the young Gotham woman being held captive by "smear cop" Frank Notaro. 
<br /><br />
Dent was instantly dubbed Gotham's "White Knight" and the incident resuscitated his moribund campaign. Ever since, Harvey Dent's campaign rallies have been mammoth affairs, with thousands of Gotham citizens vying to hear the candidate rail against corruption and crime. 
<br /><br />
But will all that excitement make a difference come election day? "All that clapping and cheering can't put Harvey Dent in the District Attorney's chair," said media manager Cypes. "The only thing that matters is who goes to the polls and who they vote for."
