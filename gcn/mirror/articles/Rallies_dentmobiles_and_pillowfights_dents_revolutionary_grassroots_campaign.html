                   <h1>RALLIES, DENTMOBILES, AND PILLOWFIGHTS: DENT'S REVOLUTIONARY GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN</h1> 
<p>
    <img alt="" src="../images/Dent_event_small.jpg" />
You can't take a walk in Gotham these days without seeing the enormous outpouring of support for Harvey Dent. 
<br /><br />
Lawn signs with the familiar slogan "Take Back Gotham" are visible on almost every street in the neighborhood. Window placards look down upon almost every shopping district. 
<br /><br />
And everywhere, you can see Dent supporters, young and old, of every color and background, passing out flyers and talking to Gotham voters. 
<br /><br />
And it all started with a phone call. 
<br /><br />
"I'd been trying to get Harvey Dent to run for District Attorney for months," Dent's media manager Allan Cypes said. 
<br /><br />
"But Harvey said he wasn't sure Gotham City was ready to take on crime and corruption like he wanted to. So I asked him, what if Gotham citizens prove to you that they're ready?" 
<br /><br />
When Cypes got Dent's answer that he would run for District Attorney if Gotham citizens proved they were ready for radical change, Cypes went into action. 
<br /><br />
He compiled a list of Gotham voters' phone numbers, and recorded Harvey Dent making a plea to citizens. 
<br /><br />
That's how, in early March, Gotham citizens received a phone call from none other than Assistant District Attorney Harvey Dent. 
<br /><br />
"Do you want a Gotham free from the grip of criminals and the corrupt?" voters heard Harvey Dent ask them. "Are you ready to join a crusade to take back our city?
<br /><br />
The answer, for thousands of Gotham citizens, was "Yes." 
<br /><br />
Within days, Gotham citizens were standing outside on street corners in a petition drive to sign up citizens who pledged to support Dent's fight against organized crime. Dent posters, placards, buttons, and t-shirts became inescapable features of the Gotham landscape. 
And thousands of photos and videos flooded into Dent's website. 
<br /><br />
"We were overwhelmed with support," said Dent's web campaign manager Abdul Al-Maliki. "It took me hours to cull through all the emails and submissions, but it was worth it to save this city." 
<br /><br />
Harvey Dent even brought his message of change to Gotham voters outside the city. "Dentmobiles" - vans full of Dent campaign materials - visited dozens of cities throughout the United States. Hundreds of Dent supporters welcomed the Dentmobiles everywhere from Seattle to Philadelphia, and Dent's message went national. 
<br /><br />
But with all the serious talk about crime, corruption, and the future of Gotham, it wasn't all grim determination for Dent supporters. One rally of a group of Dent supporters in Manhattan turned into a massive pillow fight. 
<br /><br />
Generating a massive outpouring of support, the Dent campaign has motivated Gotham citizens to participate in politics in a radically different way then in previous elections. We'll see if it all adds up to victory on election night.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
