<p>Thanks for your tip! Maiden Avenue Report couldn't be as AWESOME as it is without you, the citizens of Gotham, helping me out. If this tip is pretty juicy, I'll try to find some confirmation of it and may even lead with it! And if it's false, I'll figure it out. I always do.
<br /><br />
Keep it cool.
