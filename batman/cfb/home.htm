There’s only one man who has devoted his life, his soul and even his identity to fighting Gotham’s criminals wherever they may lurk.  He is the one we call “Batman” and he’s under fire from the media and the establishment.  They’ve never understood his quiet brand of justice, but the latest development is that we, the members of CFB, are also starting to take the heat.
<br /><br /><br />
<center><img alt="" src="images/nottheproblem.jpg" /></center>
<br /><br />
The public has the wrong opinion about Citizens for Batman.  Well, who could blame them?  According to the liberal press, we’re a bunch of violent hooligans who roam the streets looking for trouble.  They only got one thing wrong: those are the people we’re working against.
<br /><br /><br />

<center><img alt="" src="images/realenemy.jpg" /></center>
<br /><br />
CFB was founded as a network of concerned Gothamites who keep a watchful eye out for thugs, robbers and worse.  These should be the targets of public scorn, not us.  We are a peaceful organization that operates within the confines of the law and we always have.  Don’t believe the hype; CFB is here to help Batman without hurting anyone, we’re here to clean up this town and we’re here to stay!
                           
<br /><br /><br />                           
                           
                           
                           
                           
                            
                                It's like a bad dream. Gotham citizens are under attack. We've been attacked,
                                robbed, knifed, assaulted, even murdered. 
                                <br /><br /><br /><br />
                                <center><img alt="" src="images/appears.jpg" /></center>
                                <br /><br />
                                For the first time, we have hope. Batman proves we can fight back against the 
                                sociopaths, thugs, and scum that have ruled Gotham for too long. 
                                <br /><br />
                                And now, City Hall wants to arrest Batman!  
                                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />          
                                <center><img alt="" src="images/fight.jpg" /></center>

                                <br /><br />
                                Batman has given us hope back. He's given us back a sense of power over our
                                own lives. He's saved lives. 
                                <br /><br />
                                Now, Batman needs our help! 
                                <br /><br />
                                Don't let Batman be arrested. Don't let the politicians and the corrupt cops win.
                                Don't give in to crime and corruption. 
                                <br /><br /><br />

<strong>VOTE "YES" ON PROP D</strong>
<br />
Batman has been called many things - a menace, a legend, an enigma - but, the one title that seems to follow him wherever he goes is "vigilante."  Because of this label, Batman has been unfairly dogged by the Gotham authorities for far too long.  But now, voters have the chance to help him do his job.  Proposition D will require the Gotham Police to turn their priorities from so-called "vigilantes" and make them focus their efforts on the real criminals.  So, when you go to the polls, say "yes" to a safer city, say "yes" to supporting a true hero and say "yes" to Prop D. 
<br /><br /><br />
<strong>BATMAN CHIC</strong>
<br />
When Marc Uttansky's wife dragged him to a costume party last weekend, he was dreading it.  But, then he had an epiphany: he decided to dress as the Batman.  "It was easy, really," explained Uttansky.  "I just made the head out of an old kickball, painted it black, applied some electrical tape that looked like ears and voila!"  When partygoers voted on their favorite outfit, Uttansky took second place and he was happy to share the credit.  "Thanks, Batman.  We're lookin' good!"

<strong>PUT UP YOUR DUKES</strong>
<br />

The Citizens for Batman will be conducting self-defense classes after their weekly meetings every Thursday, 8pm, at GCCC.  These classes are open to the public, but CFB reminds all participants that these are non-violent workshops meant to increase your awareness, dexterity and sense of preservation in the face of an attack.  We are not to use these techniques as an offense.  That being said, Pedro Malangue is making real strides in his patented "roundhouse scissor punch" technique.  See you on Thursday!

<div style="font-size:18px; font-weight:bold;">King James Bible (Psalms 8:2), "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger."  
Whether young or old, black or white, rich or poor, the citizens of Gotham have placed our trust in Batman!</div>

<strong>BATMAN BRINGS HOPE TO SKID ROW</strong><br />
Life is tough for the vagrants in the rat-infested streets of Q5; violence, drugs and ok.  The area is one of the worst in the city, but that didn't scare Batman! 
 "He swooped down from that buildin' ova' there!" said one guy that CFB talked to. 
"One minute, I'm getting' pushed around by a couple a' punk kids, and the next minute he's savin' my hide.  What a guy!"  
Batman saves the day! 
<br /><br /><br />
<strong>ALL ABOARD!</strong><br />
Spread the word: the Gotham Monorail is open for business. The city's daily commuters took to the rail system with a renewed sense of confidence last Wednesday. And Citizens For Batman know why - cuz of Batman! 
"I used to be scared to take public transportation," admitted Maxine Fleiner-Baer, a member of CFB since the beginning. 
"But, who needs to worry with a strapping hero like [Batman] watching over us?"  Who needs to worry?  I'll tell you who: anyone who crosses the strong arm of the law.  And, no, I'm not talking about the crooked cops of this festering berg; I'm talking about Batman.  Beware, evildoers, because the subway belongs to the citizens once again!
<br /><br /><br />
<strong>THE NEXT GENERATION OF BAT-FANS</strong><br />
11-year-old Francisco Gracia-Godinez won the citywide essay contest with his report entitled, "We Owe Our Life to Batman."  
The 500-word effort details how Frank and his family barely avoided a gruesome death at the hands of the Gambol crime syndicate recently. "He's the bravest man I've ever seen," little Franky said. "Even braver than my dad, the president and the whole army, too."
                        
                        
<br /><br /><br />                   
                        
                        

<strong>BATMAN does it again!</strong><br /> 
He saves another innocent Gothamite from the clutches of evil! 
Citizens for Batman has invited his latest rescue, Ulyana Kasparkova, to the next meeting to share with us her incredible story! Don't miss it! 
<br /><br />
Here's what we know - Ulyana was walking down Fleeting Avenue last Thursday. Suddently, ski-masked thugs came out of nowhere and pulled out a pistol! 
<br /><br />
Then, Batman swooped in, with a classic lasso and hoist (a move he has employed at the docks, and using trees, at Harlow Park) . Batman roped the gunman and left him dangling from a light pole for police to pick up later! 
<br /><br />
Kasparkova has accepted our invite and will tell all! She also works as a dental technician and is expected to offer Citizens for Batman discounts on teeth cleaning! Way to go, Ulyana!!!!!
