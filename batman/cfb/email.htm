Dear Gotham Citizen,
<br /><br />
Thanks for expressing your interest in joining Citizens for Batman. The easiest way you can join is by attending a meeting. Check the web site for meeting times. If you can't attend, you can always lobby City Hall to support Batman and stop any talk of his being arrested.
<br /><br />
Looking forward to seeing you,
<br /><br />
Brian Douglass
<br /><br />
Founder and President, Citizens for Batman </p>
