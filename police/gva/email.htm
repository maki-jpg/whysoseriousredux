<p><strong>RE: PTSD Help</strong>
<br /><br />
We have received your email and we hope to send you a more personal response as soon as possible. GVAF is a volunteer organization and the consequences of the Fear Toxin attack in The Narrows have led to an overwhelming number of requests for assistance. We are attempting to respond as quickly as possible.
<br /><br />
Gotham City Services has set up special programs for assistance with housing or for assistance with symptoms associated with the Fear Toxin attack.
<br /><br />
Again, our apologies for our inability to respond at this time.
