<p>Thank you for calling the Gotham Victim Advocate Foundation.</p>
<p>If you are calling about the free psychological screening for PTSD for people living in the Narrows, we currently have a waiting list for that service. We are working with the city to expand the program.</p>
<p>If you are having symptoms of exposure to the Fear Toxin, such as hallucinations, depression, and especially thoughts of harming yourself or others, please hang up and get medical help immediately.</p>
<p>If you would like to talk to someone about our services, please leave a message. Response times are unfortunately rather long these days, as we are a volunteer organization, but we will do our best to address your concerns.</p>
