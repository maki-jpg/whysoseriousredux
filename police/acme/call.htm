<p>You've reached the Acme Security Systems automated voice messaging system. If you are calling because your Acme system indicates a security issue such as an intruder or fire, your Acme system has already alerted authorities. Please hang up and see to your own immediate safety.</p>
<p>If you are calling for information, or to schedule a home security evaluation, or about our new air and water monitoring program, please leave a brief message.
