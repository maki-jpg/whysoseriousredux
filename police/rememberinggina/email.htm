<p>I'm Gina's Aunt Gail and I'm maintaining this website for my sister, Gina's mother. Thank you for your remembrance of Gina. So many people have moved away from the old neighborhood that it's easy to forget how many people are still here. When we first moved here, I can remember we used to all sit on the stoops and the whole neighborhood knew each other. But that was before the Stratalinni's Grocery on the corner was burned down--I remember Gina and her sister used to beg for quarters to go down there and buy candy.
<br /><br />
It was a different place then. Now I know my son will never allow my new grandson to go down to the avenue on his own. Everybody is locked up tight in the evening, we don't see each other. It takes a tragedy to remember we have neighbors.
<br /><br />
Thank you for reminding us.
