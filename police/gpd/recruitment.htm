<p><strong>** CAREER F.A.Q.**</strong>
<br /><br />
<strong>How do I apply for police work?</strong>
<br />First you must take the Police Civil Service exam. Applications for the exam are available at City Hall. You must bring two forms of ID, one of which must be a government issued ID with photo.
<br /><br />
<strong>When will the next class be hired?</strong>
<br />
There is a class enrolled currently in the Police Academy. There are no further hirings scheduled at this time. There will be notices in the newspaper, at City Hall, and on this website when the next exam is scheduled.
<br /><br />
<strong>I was recently discharged from the military, how do I get back on the list?</strong>
<br />
If your exam is still valid, report to the Retention Unit with your LL332 and proof of age and residency.
<br /><br />
<strong>How long is this exam good for?</strong>
<br />
All exams can be terminated one (1) year from the date the list was established, unless extended by the City Personnel Director for a maximum of four (4) years.
<br /><br />
<strong>I am overage for appointment as a police officer. Are there any public safety positions that I may apply for?</strong>
<br />
School Safety Agent and Traffic Enforcement Agent have no maximum age requirement.
<br /><br />
<strong>How can I prepare to successfully complete the Job Standard Test?</strong>
<ol>
<li>Avoid junk food and concentrate on a well balanced diet for several days before the test.</li><br />
<li>Avoid tranquilizers and stimulants such as caffeinated beverages especially on the day of the test.</li><br />
<li>Studies have shown that brief, but intense exercise will use muscle glycogen and blood glucose (carbohydrate) at a very high rate. To optimize performance and enhance the recovery from this type of intense exercise we suggest the following nutritional guidelines:</li>
<blockquote>a. To have carbohydrates available for energy production, candidates should consume a moderate to high carbohydrate diet (60-75% of the total kcal consumed per day) for 2-3 days prior to testing. We suggest carbohydrates from whole grains (breads, cereal, rice, pasta), vegetables (carrots, corn, potato, squash), fruits (dried, juice, or solid such as orange, apple, etc.), and dairy (fat-free yogurt, skim milk, low-fat ice cream) food groups. Foods such as baked beans, pretzels, baked chips and low-fat cookies are other sources of carbohydrate.<br /><br />
		b. To recover from a day of intense activity and to restore muscle carbohydrate, candidates should eat 50 to 100 grams of carbohydrate immediately after the activity and another 50-100 grams every 2-3 hours after the activity for 12 hours. It is recommended that a total of 400-800 grams of carbohydrate be ingested depending upon the amount and intensity of the testing and your body size (bigger people need more carbohydrate). In addition to the carbohydrate, candidates should consume 15-25 grams of protein with each carbohydrate feeding (20 grams of protein is found in one 3-oz. serving of meat).<br /><br />
		c. To prevent dehydration during testing, candidates should drink water throughout the testing day. Sports drinks are not necessary, but candidates may drink them to help replenish carbohydrate and maintain electrolyte balance. These fluids are convenient, effective and good tasting.<br /><br />
		d. To maximize performance during testing, we recommend rest for the two days prior to testing. If a candidate must exercise, only very light training should be undertaken over approximately two days leading up to testing. Muscle fatigue, muscle soreness and muscle depletion of energy stores will lead to poor performance on this test.<br /><br />
		e. In conclusion, candidates should consume a carbohydrate rich diet, but include adequate protein intake as suggested above. Also drink fluids (water, sports drinks) and take a rest day from exercise training prior to testing<br /><br /></blockquote>
<li>Get a good night’s sleep before the test.</li>
<li>Be non-smokers if at all possible (or have refrained from smoking for at least 90 minutes prior to testing).</li>
<li>Refrain from any exercise training for at least 24 hours before testing.</li>
<li>Refrain from eating for at least 1.5 hours before testing.</li>
<li>For both comfort and safety, wear a T-shirt (long sleeve T-shirts or sweatshirts are permissible), sweat pants and court shoes/sneakers (running shoes are discouraged). A pair of snug, batting-style gloves are recommended for testing, but not required.</li>
<li>Avoid alcohol several days prior to testing.</li>
</ol>
Simple activities such as a regular stretching and running routine can greatly enhance your chances of doing well on a physical ability exam. Please remember to keep safety in mind when training, and always consult a physician before beginning any physical fitness program.
<br /><br />
On the day of testing you will be required to wear long pants. Please Note: You will not be allowed to participate in the examination if you are not wearing long pants. Shorts are not allowed for safety reasons.
