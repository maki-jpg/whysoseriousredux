The Gotham Police Department was established in the early 1800's to replace local constabulatory forces - often private organizations that local business owners paid to patrol the streets.  With the establishment of a local police department, Gotham City became one of the first cities in the U.S. to address the needs of citizens for safety and protection.
<br /><br />
Today, Gotham Police Department is on the forefront of forensic technology and the most cutting-edge concepts in public safety.  With the addition of the Major Crimes Unit, the Gotham Police Department is prepared to face the challenges of law enforcement in the 21st Century.

<strong>Neighborhood Watch Associations:</strong>
<br /><br />
The number of Neighborhood Watch associations has increased over 200% in the last six months.  Involvement of citizens is good for the neighborhood, and good for Gotham.  Gotham City PD has a program on good practices.  Information is available at local precincts.
<br /><br />
Good practices include:
<br /><br />
- CPR and First Aid training for all participants.
<br /><br />
- Dress in light colors and carry flashlights.
<br /><br />
- Neighborhood Watch teams should patrol in pairs, and should always carry communication.  In the event you witness a crime, call the police!  Police have the training and the equipment to deal with situations.  It is all too easy for an enthusiastic but untrained person to become a victim, adding to the situation rather than resolving it.
<br /><br /><br />


<strong>Know your rights:</strong>
<br /><br />
- You should be treated with dignity and respect.  At no time may Gotham PD officers ask you to pay a fine with cash at the time of the incident.  Asking for such payment, as well as making one, is illegal.
<br /><br />
- You have the right to have any inappropriate situation addressed.  Report any inappropriate behavior to the office of internal affairs or to the District Attorney's office.  Try to have as much information as possible about the officer, including name and badge number.
<br /><br /><br />


<strong>Teen Curfew:</strong>
<br /><br />
In the wake of the Narrows Attack and the recent increase in violent shootings, Gotham City Council has enacted a city-wide curfew. Teens should be off the street by 10:30 p.m. week nights and 11:30 p.m. on weekends, unless accompanied by an adult.
