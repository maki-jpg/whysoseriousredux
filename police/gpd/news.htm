<strong>GET READY TO HAVE A "BALL" ON JUNE 15</strong>
<br /><br />
Friends of Gotham Police present the annual Policemen's Ball on June 15 at Sunland Ballroom. A tradition since 1915, the ball raises money to help the GPD fight crime, fund outreach programs, and to support the spouses of officers who have been wounded or killed in the line of duty. The ball also seeks to foster a sense of community involvement and to recognize the work of outstanding men and women in blue.
<br /><br />
This year's ball was made possible through the volunteer efforts of Friends who sold over $375,000 worth of tickets. "This was the best staff I ever had," said Ball coordinator Franklin Slattery-Winchell. "They went way above and beyond. The department really needs the support of the community more than ever and this was just a tremendous show of faith in the GPD by regular Gotham citizens everywhere."
<br /><br />
Not all monies raised came from ticket sales. The charitable arm of several corporations helped sponsor portions of the event. The Wayne Foundation funded a new program to train and hire unemployed men and women to work at the event with continuing education that will help them find full-time work. Gotham National Bank generously paid the rental fee of the hall and Rossi's Deli is catering the event with traditional Northern Italian fare.
<br /><br />
For the second year in a row, comedian Sid Stickler will emcee the event. "If you loved last year's show, you're sure to love this one. It's the same thing!" Also back by popular demand is Shawman's Society Swingers to provide the evening's musical entertainment. Guests will dance the night away in style to the classic sounds of yesterday complete with vocal quartet. 
<br /><br />
Friends of Gotham Police is a non-profit organization with the aim of promoting quality policing and community services in the city of Gotham.

<strong>CHIEF COUNSEL STEPS DOWN</strong>
<br /><br />
Kerry Brauerhaupt has stepped down as Chief Counsel for the Gotham PD. Kerry, who became Chief Legal Counsel when Roger Garcetti was appointed District Attorney, tendered his resignation on Friday, June 6th, citing "personal reasons" and a "desire to explore new opportunities in the private sector."
<br /><br />
"We are sorry to see this dedicated servant leave the GPD," Commissioner Loeb said at yesterday's press conference where the announcement was made. "He has served the department through some tough times and I would like to thank him on behalf of the entire department."
<br /><br />
Brauerhaupt began his career as a public defender in the 18th Circuit. After three years, he joined the firm of Tarpacci and Saks, long-time outside legal counsel for the GPD. It didn't take long for him to make a name for himself as a staunch defender of the force. Brauerhaupt turned down a partnership when he was recruited by his predecessor Jeremiah Turlington into the General Counsel's office. Brauerhaupt became a welcome addition to the office and helped build it into one of the city's most able legal teams. Several years into the job, Brauerhaupt discovered Turlington misappropriating department funds. "It was a shocking thing," Brauerhaupt said. "A terrible time." Upon Jeremiah Turlington's termination, Bruaerhaupt was promoted.
<br /><br />
At the press conference, Bruaerhaupt thanked the Commissioner "for your support all these years, but most importantly, for the pleasure of working with such a great group of attorneys." With characteristic wit, Brauerhaupt concluded, "I'm sure we'll work together again soon, but hopefully not from the other side of the bench."

<strong>SGT.  FRANK NOTARO RECEIVES GOTHAM MEDAL OF COMMENDATION</strong>

<br /><br />
At a ceremony in City Hall's Banquet Room yesterday, Gotham Police Department Sgt. Francis X. Notaro received the Gotham Medal of Commendation. It is the highest medal one can receive from the Mayor of Gotham, and requires "an extraordinary act of courage in the face of real danger to one's self."  Mayor Garcia as well as numerous other dignitaries were there to honor Sgt. Notaro, who was accompanied to the event by his wife Hannah and his two children, Samuel, 7, and Rachel, 4.
<br /><br /> 
The commendation emerged from Sgt. Notaro's actions of May 13 of last year. A crazed gunman began shooting up passers-by in an alley downtown off of Jackson and Columbus at around 2 AM. 
<br /><br />
Notaro, who was not on duty at that hour but happened to be close by, heard the shots, went straight to the scene of the incident, and shot and killed the perpetrator. Notaro's actions put himself at grave risk of death, while saving the lives of innocent bystanders. 
<br /><br />
"Sgt. Notaro reflects the very best of Gotham," said Mayor Garcia. "He represents the spirit of dedication, duty, and commitment to the rule of law that we all can admire."
<br /><br />
At the time, police officers called the fact that no passers-by were killed "an absolute miracle." But Commissioner Loeb, in his remarks, said that the absence of deaths was "no miracle." 
<br /><br />
"There was no miracle that night," said Commissioner Loeb. "Instead, there was something perhaps as rare: true bravery. Sgt. Notaro is a hero, and I am proud to serve with him on the best police force in the nation, the Gotham City Police Department." 
<br /><br />
A dinner honoring Sgt. Notaro for the honor - and his birthday, which happened to also fall on the auspicious day - was held by a group of his friends later that night, at Rossi's Deli & Grill.
