<p>You've reached Betty's House of Pies, if you're looking for orders for pick-up, and the staff isn't allowed to use this business line for personal calls. This week's specials are pumpkin pie, chocolate pecan pie, and our holiday eggnog cream. As you know, we're busy this time of year and sometimes we run out early. If you need to talk to someone, leave a message.
