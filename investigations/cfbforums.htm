In the meeting, there was a lot of talk about forming neighborhood watch committees. I'm assuming everybody here is pretty clear on what this means. Let's talk about taking back our neighborhoods. We know the police are no help, let's talk about TAKING MATTERS INTO OUR OWN HANDS

I think we should talk about buddy-ing up. I really respect Batman, but we aren't him. I don't know about your neighborhood but since I don't think I can jump off a roof top and clobber guys, I'd like someone out there who has my back.
</div>
<div class="email">

<br /><br />
I'm not saying you can't have a buddy. But I'm just saying it makes it harder. You gotta find someone, someone you can trust. Me, I'd rather go it alone.

It's pretty much the same as scuba diving. You need someone if you get in trouble.

We should leave the acrobatics to Batman. I've got two kids. I want things to get better in my neighborhood and I'm willing to do a real neighborhood watch, you know, with neighborhood guys on patrol and all that, but much as I admire Batman, I think the guy has a bit of a death wish, you know? And I don't.
</div>
<div class="email">
ZincBadger
<br /><br />
That sounds good, but the problem is, you're out there, patrolling your neighborhood, and you see something, if you call the cops they might come in a couple of hours. They might not come at all. The criminals know that. You've got to scare them yourself.

As I have pointed out before, there is a social contract between the city and its citizens. The police force is supposed to provide protection. But the police won't or can't keep their end of the bargain. The only recourse is for us to protect ourselves.
</div>
<div class="email">

Batman has given us hope. Somebody had a big post about him as a symbol (I'm not going to go through threads to find it.) But I looked around the last meeting and saw a bunch of guys (and a couple of girls) who were just ordinary people. Batman has some sort of fancy stealth vehicle. I drive a ten year old Volvo that my wife's parents handed down to us. It's got a kid's car seat in the back. Taking matters into our own hands is going to be dangerous. I'm not sure I want to do that.

Tell BigEd we're all thinking of him.
<br /><br />
I've been thinking about how crazy this is to go out at night, walking through my neighborhood, 'protecting' people. I'm just an ordinary guy, you know? Got two kids. Boys, 6 and 8. Could really use my sleep. My wife thinks I'm selfish, putting myself at risk 'playing Batman.'
<br /><br />
My kids play 'Fear Toxin' in the backyard. They run around spraying each other and screaming with fear. It probably doesn't mean any more than when we were kids and we used to play war. There was a hill in my parents back yard and me and the other kids in the neighborhood used spend hours screaming 'grenade!' and throwing ourselves down that hill. But it feels different to me, maybe because their uncle, my brother-in-law, got a dose of fear toxin. He's been in and out of the hospital.
<br /><br />
When I got home from work yesterday, I parked my truck &#40;I'm an electrician&#41; and I heard the kids playing in the back. I looked over the fence to see what they were doing. My oldest boy had a towel tied around his neck. He was Batman, and he was saving the younger from 'bad guys.'
<br /><br />
It made me feel good. It felt like hope.

I just wanted to say a warm "hello" to everyone I met at the last meeting. I have been dealing with this anger, this sadness, for so long and I didn't know where to put it. How to handle it. I guess I've never had to deal with death, violent death, some stupid meaningless death of somebody close to me before.
<br /><br />
Maybe I should introduce myself, for everyone. I'm a pizza guy. Me and my family have put everything we own into this great little pizzeria. Gotham's finest, let me tell you. It's the hardest work I've ever done, and I worked construction for years. Then one day one of our best workers was mugged on a delivery. Who knows who did it? The cops never arrested anybody.
<br /><br />
They not only took the 28 dollars he had on him, but they stole his pizza and left him beat up in the car. It's hard even to write this. I had no idea what to do, how to deal with everything. But then I heard about Citizens for Batman. And then when I got to that meeting, I felt at home, like you guys were all family.
<br /><br />
So thanks for all your support. And next time we're planning something, I'll bring the slices!

Hi everyone. I don't mean to use this forum as a place to test new restaurant ideas, but since I spend all my time on pizza, I don't have a chance to get out and talk to a lot of people. Anyway, I'm thinking about adding some "gourmet" toppings to the menu. I hear sun dried tomatoes are popular. Any ideas?

Show Your Pride: Make a CFB Video!

Guys, I got a great idea. For anyone who's been reading the papers or checking out the local news, Citizens for Batman has a public relations problem. Reporters are making us look like a bunch of crazies. So, here's what I think we all should do: make a video showing them who we are. What we believe in. Do it in front of a black background, no masks or hoods or anything, just you. And just start talking to camera about what We believe in. We believe in Gotham, in safety, etc. End it the same way: "I am a citizen for batman." And then send it off to GCN. Show the world that we are not a bunch of psychos! <a href="batmangcn.htm#vid">I think we can get some really good distribution for the best ones</a>. OK? Cool!

I really feel like we've let Batman down with the failure to pass Prop D. We're supposed to be supporting Batman and we haven't been doing a very good job of it I think. That's why me and <a href="#gcr">Batfan73</a> have been cooking up a little sumthin' special. It's going blow all you guys away and show the world that Batman rocks!

Seems there's been a bit of a slipup with <a href="#special">the project me and Batfan73 have been working on</a>. BatFan's in jail and I need everyone's help. He left me a voicemail, it was kinda garbled, but he said he was picked up by the cops for trespassing, so he needs some help getting everything activated. He's not sure when he's going to be able to extract himself from his situation.
<br /><br />
He said he needs someone to get some sort of key off of an invoice, number 38272899 &#40;geez, I hope I copied that down right&#41;, but he got cut off before he could tell me what this invoice is or even where to find it. We need this key to activate everything.
<br /><br />
<a href="#gcr">Can anyone figure this out?</a> We're going to need to fix this or the whole thing's ruined! Anyone?
