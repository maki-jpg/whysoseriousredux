<br /><br />
I've been patrolling my neighborhood for several weeks now. I've seen crime happen in front of me. It's obvious City Hall doesn't care, so why should we? I think that's an important question to answer before we set out to DO SOMETHING about crime in Gotham. The answer might be different for each of us. For me, I want to fight because I lost my sister to violent crime. She was attacked and brutally assaulted when she was leaving a group of friends at a restaurant early one Sunday night. Someone was waiting for her by her car. She screamed and yelled "fire," but no one came to help. Unlike many victims, she went to the police, but they didn't do anything. They gave her the runaround for months until she found her own peace. I fight for my sister. I fight so bad things don't happen again to anyone. I fight because the police won't. I fight to take back the city I used to be proud to call home.

It sounds like this is the right place to be. I'm glad I found you guys here. I fight because I believe in doing what's right. Not only is it right to take control over our lives, it's right to help Batman. He can't do it all alone. He's showing us the way. All we need to do is follow.

I've been thinking about how to get our group off the ground. The first thing we should do is get organized. We can't be a collective of loose cannons if this is going to work. We have to do this together, as a real unit.

No one put anyone in charge. But someone is going to have to step up and help guide the group or we'll be chasing our tails for weeks. Mob wisdom is and oxymoron if you ask me.

He's a good guy. He means well. I don't think he'll join us though, not after he made all those statements to the press about "purging" CFB of radicals. Can you picture him here? "Look ma, no hands. I joined the radicals after all!"

You can't go wrong with baby steps. Whatever we do first, should be small. What about breaking up drug deals in parks during the day? If we go in groups, it shouldn't be too dangerous. We can build to larger things as we get more experience.

First, you keep your mouths shut. This group and this board must remain top secret. If you look over at the <a href="cfbforums.htm">CFB forum</a>, you'll see that the police are still interested in them. We want things to stay that way. Let them look over <a href="../suspects/douglass.htm">Brian's</a> group all they want. They won't find anything but a bunch of losers wasting their time.

I think we need a secret handshake or symbol so we can identify ourselves to each other in the streets.

I made the decision I did because I thought it was more important to keep the group safe. But I was watching GCN the other night and caught <a href="../gcn/gothamtonight3.htm">this story about this kid named Tim Otis</a>. If you didn't see the piece, the kid took a dose of ecstacy or something but it was laced with fear toxin. He went out of his mind and is going to live the rest of his life in a personal hell. He's not alone. That's when I knew that action was more important than words. So please, if you believe in the mission, let's put bad blood behind us and let me join you. Together for Batman.

It was great to see everyone there. With that kind of energy, we can do anything. So, let's see ? action plan. OK, like I said, everyone should know what they're doing tomorrow. I've just been informed that DarkMatter is grounded because he snuck out of the house, so he'll be posting updates to this forum for those of you who aren't participating.

Just heard from Brian. They're leaving the restaurant now and heading over to Harlow.

Which route do you think they'll take?

Probably the Orange Line. CaCa's is near the Good St. station and they can get off right near the park .

Apparently, SmokinJoe pulled <a href="#knife">his knife</a> in self defense and cut himself. The guy thought it was so funny he didn't do anything but laugh and run away.

They got the main guy! Brian got him! The runners got away, but BriDog is totally the man. BigEd tied him to a tree just like Batman and they blew out of there before the cops came.

First off, and most importantly, SmokinJoe is fine. Just a scratch. The knife was dull. Secondly, I want to thank everyone who was there when it all went down for your uncompromising bravery in standing up to crime. Lastly, I consider the bust a complete and total success. The three runners got away, but we got the guy controlling the stash.

Everyone was great. We got there and surrounded four people. Three of them were running drugs into the park and the other was controlling their stash. The runners bolted and SmokinJoe tried to take one down. I guess you heard what happened. They got away but we managed to capture the leader.

The main guy took off and Brian chased him down and tackled him to the ground. Rockingranny beat the guy with her cane until BigEd wrestled him over to a tree and go him tied up and ready to be served to the cops.

File this under Top Secret. A source tipped me off to a major drug deal going down on Wednesday night. It's very bad people, very high up, and they're making a very big deal. This could be the one action that makes everyone take us seriously. This is huge.

That's not fair. I'm going too.

It's too risky. A smaller group is more maneuverable. Trust me, these are classic tactics. We need to walk between the rain drops on this one.

No. It's not cool. she should be ok, but she'll never walk the same again. But he got off easy. <a href="../suspects/barhyte.htm">A Gotham cop</a> didn't do so well.

I don't really know how to say this. You guys didn't know him, but I did. Officer <a href="../suspects/barhyte.htm">Glenn Barhyte</a> - the man who fought by our side last night - passed away at the hospital. Glenn treated me like a person. <a href="familyemail.htm#atoz">Like a brother</a>.. And last night, I couldn't save him. He gave his life to save mine. That's what brothers on the force do. Now he's gone. Was it worth it? I don't know what else to say. <a href="../suspects/barhyte.htm">Glenn Barhyte</a>, you are a man of honor and loyalty. I will try forever to live up to your example, and to avenge your killing.

I dropped a GPS/wire unit on one of the cars at the warehouse last night.. As it was speeding by. I'll know where their next deal is going down. We will succeed this time, for Glenn. And I've got a new idea, one that will strike fear into the hearts of the enemy.
