<strong>4/24 Harvey Dent thanks supporters after smear campaign collapses</strong>
<br /><br />
The outrageous smear campaign against Harvey Dent collapsed completely today when all charges against Dent were dropped. 
<br /><br />

<div class="email">Transcript of Dent's Response to the Smears:
<br /><br />
&#91;commotion of reporters: "Mr. Dent? Mr. Dent? Harvey Dent? Harvey Dent has nothing to say! - behind these smears!"&#93;
<br /><br />
<span class="speaker">Dent:</span> Please, please. You know - yes I have been smeared. It was a vicious campaign of lies. But I am proud of and grateful for the Gotham citizens who have stood by me. When all you guys in the press fell for the most outrageous lies, it was the citizens of Gotham who tracked down those criminals and cleared my name so I'm grateful to them. Do you know why? Because the citizens of Gotham have had enough. They've had enough of the fear, and the crime, and the corruption.
<br /><br />
You know, in this campaign, I've...walked the streets of Gotham. I've visited with grandmothers so scared to take public transportation, that they haven't seen their grandchildren in months - I've met with kids who've never had the pleasure of running out and playing on the street. I've met with newlyweds who are planning on moving out of this city because they see no future here. I see a city where hope has been replaced by fear. Our movement is a movement of hope. And once the people have hope, it's not so easy to give it up again, so we will keep on fighting! And we will keep on winning. We will take Gotham back. Thank you.
<br /><br />
&#91;commotion of reporters: "Mr. Dent, are you preying on the fears of Gotham City?" etc etc&#93;

Official headquarters reopening draws thousands
<br /><br />
It was a day full of cheers, happiness, and excitement as the Dent for DA headquarters re-opened. Thousands of Gothamites filled the offices and spilled out into the streets. Harvey Dent gave a rousing speech and promised to "never forget the people who stand with us against the enemies of Gotham City."

Letter from <a href="../suspects/notaro.htm">Sgt Frank Notaro</a> to the people of Gotham
<br /><br />
<a href="../suspects/notaro.htm">Francis Notaro</a> was one of the original "smear cops" and was the hostage-taker in what has become known as <a href="ibihdpress.htm">"The White Knight Incident."</a> Here, he writes an open letter to Gotham.
<br /><br />
<em>To everyone in Gotham,
<br /><br />
I'm writing this from my jail cell. It's terrible in here, and a lot of my family and friends are too scared or ashamed to visit me. I don't blame them.
<br /><br />
But Harvey Dent did visit me. Me, the guy who spread horrible lies about him. And pointed a gun at him.
<br /><br />
Maybe it wasn't my gun that did it, but I can't help but feel responsible for the death of an innocent woman.
<br /><br />
Her name was Mary Breitup, and she was sitting in the wrong place at the wrong deli that terrible day.
<br /><br />
I wake up in the middle of the night, wishing somebody had been able to warn Mary, to get her out of that place before all hell broke loose. But nobody did. I know it's wishful thinking. Who would have warned her? <a href="rossisdeliwiretap.htm">Who knew what was about to happen?</a>
<br /><br />
Now, I have to live every day with this terrible guilt. And the Breitup children have to grow up without their <a href="../suspects/breitup.htm">father</a> or mother. I break a little every day thinking about it.
<br /><br />
I'm not asking for forgiveness. But I regret every single thing that I have done in the last year.
<br /><br />
And when I think I can't go on any more -- when I think I don't want to go on any more -- I think of the man who showed more courage than I could ever imagine having. Harvey Dent. Nobody can bring back Mary. But if Gotham elects Harvey Dent, maybe things will change. Maybe the mob won't own the city anymore. Maybe fewer cops will turn dirty. And maybe fewer innocents like Mary will die.
<br /><br />

Volunteers needed for "Night of a Thousand Candles"
<br /><br />
The Dent Campaign is planning a night where citizens march through our most dangerous neighborhoods, holding candles to commemorate the victims of violent crime. We are putting out the call for people who'd like to march, distribute water and food, be safety monitors, and just want to see how they can help our movement for change. Please contact us to find out how you can join the wave of support to take Gotham back!

Harvey Dent calls for prosecution of "smear leaders"
<br /><br />
Harvey Dent today called for prosecution of the "ringleaders" of the bogus smear campaign against him. In particular, he said that founder of the malicious group <a href="ccfabg.htm">Concerned Citizens for a Better Gotham</a>, <a href="../suspects/candoloro.htm">Joseph Candoloro</a>, should be investigated for "political corruption" and ties to city officials. Dent urged the GPD to open up an international investigation on the whereabouts of Candoloro, who disappeared as the smear campaign collapsed.

5/1 Fundraising soars in last week of April
<br /><br />
The Harvey Dent campaign is proud to announce that the last week of April was the best week of fundraising we've ever had. Over 5,000 Gotham citizens donated to our campaign to Take Gotham Back, helping us get our message out with over $200,000 of critical funds. Thanks, Gotham!
</div>

<div class="email">
Night of a Thousand Candles broken up by thugs
<br /><br />
Gotham Police Department officials stood by as dozens of thugs and miscreants broke up our courageous march through dangerous neighborhoods. Five of our supporters ended up going to the hospital and three were arrested for creating a public nuisance. Harvey Dent called for an investigation of the GPD officers who "didn't do anything as political thugs beat up supporters of change."
</div>

<div class="email">
5/8 "We still have not won this race"
<br /><br />
Harvey Dent issued a call to supporters not to get complacent, as recent polling showed Dent beating opponents by double digits. "Poll numbers are not votes. We must continue to fight as the underdogs we are," Dent said at a noontime rally downtown. "The criminals and the corrupt don't read polls, and they don't listen to pundits. We have to battle them with every ounce of strength we have as if the polls don't matter, because they don't."

<div class="email">
<strong>Harvey Dent "takes no position" on "Save Batman" proposition</strong>
<br /><br />
In response to the heated argument developing over the so-called "Save Batman" proposition D, Harvey Dent put out a statement saying he takes no position on the question. "I will leave it up to the wisdom of the voter in deciding how they want scarce police resources used in this city. The larger problem is how to take back our city from criminals and corrupt officials, and that's why our movement is growing rapidly in all neighborhoods of the city."

5/15 Dent campaign asks for childcare volunteers
<br /><br />
With all the young families joining our campaign, the Dent headquarters is full of young tykes and tots running around and having all kinds of fun! In response to requests by volunteers, we're putting out the call for childcare professionals who may want to donate their time at the headquarters office to watch over some of these cute troublemakers! Please contact the volunteer coordinator at the headquarters if you'd like to help out!

Harvey Dent will be on Channel 4 at 8pm tomorrow
<br /><br />
As part of their ongoing coverage of the most exciting Gotham election in years, Channel 4 will be interviewing our own Harvey Dent at 8pm tomorrow. A viewing party will be held at the headquarters - and it's potluck, so bring out the fruitcakes and onion dips!

<div class="email">
5/20 Get Out The Vote volunteers needed!
<br /><br />
Come election day, we need to make sure that every Harvey Dent supporter gets to the polls. Whether that means calling them and nudging them, knocking on their door, or even driving them to the polling stations, we need all the help we can get. This is the most important job in the entire campaign - our hopes to change Gotham City depends on our GOTV effort. So, if you have time on election day and want to really have an impact, contact our GOTV coordinator at the headquarters!

<div class="email">
5/23 Ask Harvey!
<br /><br />
These are questions that volunteers have submitted. Harvey Dent personally answered all these questions because he deeply appreciates the help of the thousands of volunteers working to take Gotham back.
<br /><br />
Q: Do you believe that you can really change Gotham?<br />
A: I wouldn't be running if I didn't believe that change was possible. Tackling crime and corruption is not impossible, it just requires leadership and determination. This campaign has shown that Gotham citizens will fight for change, and I will make sure that Gotham City gets the safe streets we all deserve if I am elected DA.
<br /><br />
Q: What do you think about Batman?<br />
A: Batman is a symptom of a deeper problem in this city. We don't feel safe, we don't feel that the cops are protecting us, and we are all susceptible to either despair, fear, or anger because of it. While I can't condone extralegal behavior, I understand why citizens have rallied behind Batman and see him as some type of hero. I believe, however, that the city would be better off when police make our city safe and not one caped man.<br />
<br />
Q: What should I say to people who fear you are too inexperienced to take the DA's job?<br />
A: All the experience in the world hasn't made our city safe. In fact, staying in City Hall politics too long can have the reverse effect - it's easy to become enmeshed in special interests and cozy corruption. As an Assistant District Attorney, working closely with Internal Affairs, I've put more corrupt cops in prison than all these so-called "experienced" politicians.

Arson strikes Dent neighborhood offices
<br /><br />
Fire claimed two of Harvey Dent's five neighborhood campaign offices - one in Granton and another in East End. The GPD report that the fires were "suspicious" and several sources said they expected arson to be the cause. The fires are another example of a concerted campaign of fear and violence against the Dent campaign by "criminal elements desperate to continue their death grip on the city," Harvey Dent said. Thankfully, no volunteers in the offices were harmed.
</div>

<div class="email">
<strong>5/30 Harvey Dent denies "scurrilous email campaign"</strong>
<br /><br />
Harvey Dent attacked a vicious email campaign of lies and smears today. Following reports that Gotham citizens were being chain-mailed a message claiming that Harvey Dent was arrested several times in the past ten years, Harvey Dent completely denied the charges. "These charges are false. I have never been arrested. This is another smear campaign designed to stop Gotham citizens from taking back their city, and it won't work."
</div>

<div class="email">
<strong>6/4 Missing Dentmobile found outside Portland with driver bound, gagged</strong>
<br /><br />
A Dentmobile bringing Harvey Dent's message of change to Portland, Oregon was found today. The van, which went missing early in the Dentmobile "Dent Across America" campaign, was found in an abandoned factory. Tragically, the driver had been bound, gagged, and killed. We mourn for the family of the young, idealistic Dent volunteer Elliot Bryan Perersbrook.
</div>

<div class="email">
<strong>Harvey Dent plans on "continuous campaigning" till Election Day</strong>
<br /><br />
Harvey Dent today announced that he would start a "continuous campaign" from now until election day. Dent plans on holding rallies in every neighborhood of the city, and will campaign from 7AM - 11PM every day. "I want to show the citizens of Gotham that if they have the passion for change, I have the passion to make that change happen," said Dent

<h3 id="win" class="label">Victory</h3>
<p class="date">June 13</p>
<p>Following <a href="../suspects/dent.htm">Harvey Dent's</a> victory in the District Attorney election, a new update:</p>
<div class="email">
6/13 Dent victorious!
<br /><br />
Harvey Dent wishes to thank all of the people of Gotham who helped turn a grassroots movement into a resounding success on Election Day.
<br /><br />
Harvey Dent's landslide victory means great things for the city of Gotham. Because of your belief in Harvey Dent, Gotham now has a District Attorney who will make war on crime and corruption.
<br /><br />
The real work, however, is just beginning. Harvey Dent now moves on to City Hall, where every corrupt force will try to tie his hands and weaken the people's will to destroy organized crime and snuff out corruption. The movement to take back Gotham still needs your help.
<br /><br />
We hope you continue your support of Harvey Dent. More than ever, he's going to need every citizen on his side to ensure victory over the destructive forces that are wreaking havoc on our city.
