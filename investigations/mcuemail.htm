	Yes, I did receive your request to leave <a href="gpdiad.htm">IA</a> and join <a href="../suspects/gordon.htm">Gordon</a> over at <a href="gpdmcu.htm">MCU</a>. I assure you, your credentials are good enough to pave the way for any transition you want to make in the field of law enforcement and I'll support whatever decision you make, but I must ask why. You're one of the best guys we've got &#40;off the record, of course - I can't show favoritism, y'know?&#41;
	<br /><br />
	Just think about it before you interview with Jim. Once he sees your resume, he'll snatch you up in a heartbeat and I hate the idea of losing yet another honest IA detective.

	Payment Delay<div class="emaildate">June 12, 2008</div><br />
	From: Human Resources
	<br /><br />
	Dear Officer Barhyte,
	<br /><br />
	Due to missing transfer of payment information, we will not be able to issue payment drawn from the Major Crimes Unit account. The administrative clerk for your office should have filed it with Human Resources within one week of your transfer announcement. The earliest you will begin receiving paychecks under your new job category will be Friday, June 27.
	<br /><br />
	If you have any questions, please contact your human resources coordinator.

	Oh, sheesh, I feel really bad! I don't know what could have happened. I have a distinct memory I filed that paperwork as soon as your transfer order hit my desk. I remember because your social security number was unique in its numerological repetitions. I'm going down to HR first thing in the morning to sort this out. I'd go now, but it's after 4 and they're already gone. Don't worry, Glenn. I'm on the case.

	Still no word on the missing paperwork. Remember that year they were going to "professionalize the bureaucracy"? This really ticks me off. And this guy that screwed up everything - "Atoz" &#40;what kind of name is Atoz??&#41; - keeps on coming by my desk and asking me if anything's changed. It's been three minutes bro!

	Just got back from HR. They said they never got the form. I asked to go through their records and they said it's against protocol. A friend of mine gets on shift up there this afternoon. I'm going to head back up there then. In the meantime, I've already completed a new payment form and will personally walk it over to everyone who needs to sign it before lunch.

	Wow thanks a lot, man. That really means something to me. Whoa. Don't worry - you won't have to get a restraining order against me, or anything &#40;although, if you did, I'd make sure to file it in a professional, efficient manner&#41;. :D But I just wanted to say thanks a lot for saying thanks. Does that seem weird? Not to me. I do so much work around here - little things. You won't be interested in them so I won't mention 'em. The really important thing is. Well, maybe I will mention them, because nobody really knows what I do all day. People think I just push paper. And it's all good, you know, I kid around. Guys say I should start the File Olympics. We created lots of funny categories. The Manila Folding Speed Round. The Great Eraser Hunt. The Alphabet Unjumble. International Paper Cut Challenge. Stuff like that. It was a riot. Guys were on the floor. Even Gordon got into it. But nobody really knows what I do. Everything got so easy so quick. I focus like a camcorder. Incredible focus. I'm a detail kind of guy. So I do lots of stuff to make it interesting. Reverse alphabetization, record duplication &#40;or triplication!&#41;, mail organization, re-engineering the entire file flow to reduce paper costs, setting up a file system in new offices, and helping you guys out whenever I can. But nobody really says thank you. Not that it really matters. Hell, I get bored being myself. What you guys do is so much more important than what I do. But it just really makes it all worthwhile when I can help you guys out and someone, anyone, notices. Not that I'd notice someone like me if I was real police, but maybe I would, and I'd say something like, hey, Atoz, thanks a lot, what are you doing for lunch. You know? Anyway, I'm always here for you guys. Whatever you need, wherever in the alphabet it is, how many numbers or letters or slashes, I can find it for you. I can find warts on a supermodel! Candy in the diabetes wing! Meaning in a Danielle Steel novel! Anything you need, no matter how crazy, I can find. That's just how I am. Ask anybody at MCU about me. I'm their secret weapon around here. Anyways, I'll talk to you later. I like to get coffee around 11AM at the side break room.

	Re: money laundering probe, a buddy of mine in Western confirmed that bistro story -- there's some bad guys going in and out of that place, usually the back. Let's talk next actions -- surveillance? Stake out? It's your call here.

	We're still dealing with the setback. Do we have alternatives? Yes. Are they the best options? No. It was a big hit, those two <a href="../gcn/gothamtonight4.htm#lackeys">dead at the playground</a>. And why the painted smiles on their face? This case is getting odder and odder. I'm all ears regarding next steps, Glenn.

	Did you see the memo????<div class="emaildate">June 27, 2008</div><br />
	From: Atoz
	<br /><br />
	I can't believe it! Did you see the memo from the recruiting office? They cancelled the exam. They say "no additional officers will be hired in the foreseeable future."
	<br /><br />
	I can't believe this. It's almost like they're doing it to me directly. Ever feel that way? Like life is pointing its finger at you and going, "hey you... you're a loser and always will be you stupid loser."
	<br /><br />
	I can see that finger pointing at me now. It's all I can do not to crumple up in the bathroom and cry. I can't be a file clerk forever. This was my last shot. The wife said it was 'now or never', so I guess it's never. But what does that mean? Now what do I do?

	Yeah. Figured you'd seen it by now. happens all the time. One minute they have the funds, then they say they never existed in the first place.
	<br /><br />
	I'm sure there'll be another exam in a year or so when the purse strings loosen up again. Sometimes being a GPD you have to ride out these waves. It happens in every city. I'm sure you'll be a great motorcycle cop. Just keep at your job and wait for the next go round.
	<br /><br />
	In the meantime, there's a lot of ways you can help out the community that doesn't involve noise pollution at 4 in the morning.

	It feels like someone just punched me in the gut. This was all that was keeping me going. I can't go back to file, file, file. I gotta get out of this place, do something, something big. I hate this place. You're the only one who talks to me around here.

	Hey man. Thanks for lunch. You bastard - I can't believe you beat me at gorging! That Indian buffet should have been all mine. How could you have downed that last plate of curry chicken? It's against the laws of physics or something.
	<br /><br />
	And don't worry about me. I've snapped back. You were right - <a href="cfbunderground.htm#success">there's a lot I can do for our city without getting my boots and badge</a>.
	<br /><br />
	Don't worry about <a href="#case">your case that fell thru</a>. Sometimes things have to play the hard way, you know?

	Been thinking a lot about what you told me at lunch yesterday. You're right. Sometimes you have to <a href="cfbsignalchat.htm">take a stand</a>. Looks like all that help you gave me for the exam <a href="cfbunderground.htm#intervention">won't go to waste after all</a>.

Why don't you ever answer your cell phone?
<br /><br />
They pulled my case! Shut it down. No explanation. Just when I was gonna lock this one down airtight, it's gone. JUST A FEW MORE DAYS I NEEDED! It's a joke. A bad one.
<br /><br />
Maybe Dent didn't get all the rotten apples after all. Something is fishy about all of this. I want to talk to you about it offline.
