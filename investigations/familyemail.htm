	I can't believe you sent me a computer! I had your brother set it up and then he taught me email, so now I'm truly "with it" as you kids say. You are a fine son - thank you!
	<br /><br />
	Glenn, I worry about you so. You know, the Henderson kids all got into nice professions. Georgie is a airline mechanic now and Francis sells insurance. Have you ever thought about selling insurance? Myra says he makes good money. I could put you in touch with Francis if you'd like.

	The Henderson kids are a bunch of morons. They couldn't scratch two nickels together to get a dime. You never used to believe what Myra told you, anyway. What's gotten into you?

	Don't worry about me. I'm a desk jockey. The only injury I'm risking is carpal tunnel syndrome. And besides, I like putting away the bad guys.

	I had no idea you just oiled that jacket. It wouldn't have mattered if I just brought something from Bob's, but I had to go and make flaming baked Alaska! I mean, who eats flaming baked Alaska, right?
	<br /><br />
	Again, I'm really sorry. Can you forgive me? I'll get you a new jacket. I promise. You said it's irreplaceable but I believe anything is possible if you stick to it.

	I know it's not your dad's jacket, but I hope you enjoy the "new" one. The sales lady said it's the same kind as your dad's - was made by a long gone Gotham company.
	<br /><br />
	Still feeling bad about burning up the original, though. This is the least I could do, especially since you're giving me some pointers for the <a href="mcuemail.htm#exam">exam on Saturday</a>.

	Don't be grumpy. You're very sweet for letting him stay with us for a while.
	<br /><br />
	Sometimes couples go through these things. They think they're growing apart when they're really just changing as people. It can create stress I'm sure. Not that I know from my own experience, so don't go thinking that, mister policeman.
	<br /><br />
	I guess for them it's coming down to wanting different things. He seems really confused right now, and with the exam not happening I think they're both seeing their futures in different lights. They just need some time to sort through this stuff. Who knows? I'm sure we don't know the whole story. Maybe something else is going on that we don't know about. You never know what happens behind other peoples' closed doors.
	<br /><br />
	I know you didn't want him here after mom just left, but it's the right thing to do. I wouldn't lead you astray.... well... maybe a little astray.

	Know what that is? That's what everyone is calling me!

	Isn't it bad enough I pulled the July 4 shift for the third year in a row?

	First, he clips his nails all over the kitchen floor, then he's always on the computer, and now he "does me a favor" by shrinking my uniform two sizes!? There's a reason it says "dry clean only"!!!!

	What was that this morning? He didn't mean to use your toothbrush. But, you didn't have to throw it at him... with a fresh glob of toothpaste on it... that's now all over my couch &#40;notice how it's not YOUR couch anymore?&#41;
	<br /><br />
	Keep the old temper in check, sweetums - I don't want any more heart murmur scares. I've had enough to last me two lifetimes.

	<br /><br />
	Um... I don't even know how to get started. I'm really, really, really, really sorry about your TV. I saw the gun maintenance memo and thought I'd do something nice for you since you were stuck late. I was cleaning it and it just went off. I swear. It wasn't my fault. I don't know how it happened.
	<br /><br />
	Hey... on the upside, the set still turns on and gets sound... that's something, right? You can listen to TV until I can scrape together the money to replace it. I will replace it. You can count on me. I'll make this right.
	<br /><br />
	Don't think my wife was too glad to see me home last night, but I understand if you've had enough of me all week. I think I would have thrown myself out if the shoe was on the other foot.

	I hated having to come in early again with you still not feeling well. Maybe you should call the doctor?

	It's sweet that you worry, but I'll be fine. I'm sure it's nothing. I just need to catch up on some sleep. You know how much I hate doctors.

	Wish you didn't have to work this weekend. Miss you.

	I can't thank you enough. If you weren't here to get the phone who knows what would have happened. I could have lost them both. I can't even think about it. You really came through, man. I'll never forget this. Never.
	<br /><br />
	Right now the doctors say everything's fine with Cecilia and the baby but they're keeping her overnight just in case.

	I felt the baby kick again! Or it was that bad Chinese food, I can't figure it out.
	<br /><br />
	Know what I think? I think I can't wait for you to get home and curl up with me.
