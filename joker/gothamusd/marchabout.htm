<strong>The Math Plan</strong><br />
The district's Math Vertical Team developed a comprehensive plan for addressing math instruction at Gotham schools. The Math Plan is a blueprint for helping students progress from a basic understanding of math to higher level skills, such as adapting and using information in real life situations, or for preparation for college.

<br /><br />
<strong>Student Intervention</strong><br />

Students may experience problems.  They may have trouble learning, health concerns may interfere with learning, or a family crisis may prove too distracting or overwhelming.  When possible, these issues will be resolved using simple strategies such as changing a seat, using a homework sheet, or with the Peer to Peer Tutoring Program.  But if the student has difficulties not addressed by classroom strategies, it may be time to begin the intervention process.  
The first step will be to establish an Intervention Team for the student.  The group
may include teachers (both classroom and special area), school psychologist, and/or counselor, and, when necessary, a social worker, and/or nurse.  Parents, along with the student, are at the center of this team, Other members could include administrators, and special consultants (for example, a speech therapist) and, where appropriate, the student himself/herself. They meet to define the concern and to decide on a course of action to help the student achieve success.
