Our mission is to provide a safe and secure environment where students can learn and thrive.
<br /><br />
The Gotham Unified School District has adopted a Zero Tolerance Policy for drug and weapon possession.  A student found in possession of drugs or weapons (including guns, knives, nunchuks, pepper spray or anything determined to be a weapon) will be immediately suspended from school.  If the student is in possession of drugs, or has broken a law, say, by possession of a firearm, the police will be notified.
<br /><br />
Within thirty days, a hearing will be conducted.  The school administrator, a parent and the student must all attend.  At that time, there will be a determination of the length of the student’s suspension.  
<br /><br />
All High School campuses will have metal detectors installed at entrances.  Students will not be able to enter the building without going through a metal detector.  Since not all doors will have metal detectors, this means that students will have to follow school policy on entering the building.  It is possible that a door the student previously used will now be locked so as to only allow students to exit, not enter the building.  
<br /><br />

The Student Discipline Code is a 22 page booklet.  This booklet is given to every student as part of the their enrollment packet on the first day of the school year, or, in the case of transfer students, when they register for classes.  Additional copies can be obtained from the office of the school the child attends.
<br /><br />
All students have a right to a learning environment that is free from the threat of harassment, violence or discrimination.
