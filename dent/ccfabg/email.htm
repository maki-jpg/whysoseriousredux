<p>Dear Concerned Citizen,
<br /><br />
Thank you for offering to help us. All of us here at Concerned Citizens for a Better Gotham feel it is our moral duty to tell our story about Harvey Dent's unforgivable offenses against our city. We have put you on the list for a great election-night party where we will celebrate the defeat of Harvey Dent. Please continue to check the web site for further details on how you can help defeat Harvey Dent.
<br /><br />
Thank You.
<br /><br />
Joseph Candoloro, Esquire
