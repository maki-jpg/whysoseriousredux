# Why So Serious? Redux
If you're here, you probably know a little something about coding. I need your help!

I originally created this site in 2010, eons ago in tech-land. This site is woefully behind in accessibility, mobile-responsiveness, but most importantly, *the Flash games and maps have not worked since 2020 or so.* 

I know that [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) can be used as a Flash emulator, but I haven't gotten around to poking at it and testing it. (To be honest, I'm kind of shocked I managed to squirrel away the Flash games from their original homes to begin with, but they all worked the last time Flash was supported by browsers.) And considering I work in the high-impact government space and am currently raising a preschooler, I'm doubtful I'll find the time to do it anytime soon!

I'll seed the issues as I can, but everything on the site is in this repo if you want to poke at it yourself!

## To dos at a high level
- âœ… Convert FLV videos to MP4 and moved them off of GitHub (honestly, to get the site below the 1GB limit for GitHub Pages ðŸ˜œ)
- âœ… Switch from Flash audio player to use native `<audio>`
- Add alt tags to all the images, especially the Jokerized ones
- Add mobile responsiveness (although I'm iffy on this, there's a certain charm to the "clunky intranet" concept)
- Convert the Gotham map to not use Flash
- Convert all the Joker games in the `joker/WSS/games` folder to not use Flash
